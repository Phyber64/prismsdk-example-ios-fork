This sample demonstrates how to use PrismSDK

## How to use

1. Download the project
2. Update the CodeSinging configurations
3. Request Configuration file from Prismlabs.
   1. If you got `PrismSDK-Info.plist`,  drag it into your project (it's easiest if you place it just next to `Info.plist`)
   2. If you received `API_KEY` & `API_URL`, then edit the existing `PrismSDK-Info.plist` with the new values.
