# ReferenceApp

This Example Project is used to demonstrates how to use [PrismSDK](https://github.com/prismlabs-tech/prismsdk-ios)

## Quick Start

- Request Configuration file from Prismlabs `contact@prismlabs.tech`.
- Download the `PrismExampleApp` project
- Update the CodeSinging configurations
- Add configurations into project
- Run the app

### Configurations can be done in two ways

   1. `PrismSDK-Info.plist`:  
   drag it into your project (it's easiest if you place it just next to `Info.plist`)
   2. On object initialization:  
   If you received `API_KEY` & `API_URL`, then edit the existing `PrismSDK-Info.plist` with the new values.
